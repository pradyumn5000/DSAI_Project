**SC1015 - Song-Popularity analysis ♫**

**About**
This SC1015 Mini-Project focuses on finding what makes a song popular based on many variables. Two datasets are extracted from [Spotify’s API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres?resource=download) respectively, and then merged together. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:
