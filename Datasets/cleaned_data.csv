But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street
Right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me
While her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean
The Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs
Do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with
Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts
And then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me
Like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called
Was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice
Playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room
Swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome
And it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs
With the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

All that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
And all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've given you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man

My pride, my ego
My needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you
To walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up
The mess I made
And it haunts me
Every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance

Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say
That I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably
Much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers,
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance

Days when the rains came
Down in a hollow
Playin' a new game

Laughin' and a runnin' hey hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog
With our, our hearts a thumpin'
And you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

And what ever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Gone down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
Slippin' and a slidin'
All along the waterfall
With you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da (just like that)
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
La ti da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, you have grown

Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when

Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
But the worst's yet to come

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she? ""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

He's got a one hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
he says ""baby, is something wrong?""

I say nothin'
I was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song
and he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh,
the first date, man, I didn't kiss her and I should have
and when I got home
Before I said amen
askin' God if He could play it again

I was walkin' up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway
well on my way
to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said:

When I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

I see the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way
Through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin' you ""Please don't go""

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out
To the garden to see you
We keep quiet
Cause we were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

Cause you were Romeo
I was a Scarlett Letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
And I was beggin' you Please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say ""Yes""

Romeo save me
They're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
But it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say ""Yes""

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

Romeo save me
I've been feelin' so alone
I keep waiting for you
But you never come
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring

And said

Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you
And that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress

A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win
some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues

And that`s home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it`s not much to talk about
But it`s filled with love that`s grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

And the radio up
Well I`ve seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman`s eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother`s love

Well its funny how it`s the simple things in life that mean the most
Not where you live what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There`s no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I`ve come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried

And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.

47,Say You Won't Let Go,2016-09-09,james arthur,False,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
Cause I played it cool when I
Was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise, till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go

hot that I melted

some or learn some

Open up your plans and damn you're free

you'll find love love love

It's your God-forsaken right
to be loved love loved love loved

But do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking
my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just
to try to see it clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying
is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do,
our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and

The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore younger man's clothes""

La la la, de de da

Chorus:
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As a smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davi who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As a businessman slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Chorus

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

That's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio

Hope there's a conversation
That we both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation I know
That much is understood
And I realize...

If you asked me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I'll go out and I'll sit down
At a table was set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and put it to hell
But still you're magnificent

I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back at the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not, even close, without you

If you asked me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I'll go out and I'll sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you

And if I had a chance to renew
You know that isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

Showed you how to read a map

And if I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like with your hands ""look Travie, I can handle that""

It's just this last girl that played me left a couple of cracks

96,Carnival Ride,2007-10-23,carrie underwood,False,All-American Girl,"Since the day they got married,
He'd been praying for a little baby boy.
Someone he could take fishing,
Throw the football and be his pride and joy.

He could already see him holding that trophy,
Taking his team to state.
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket,
All those big dreams changed.

Chorus
And now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful,
wonderful, perfect All-American Girl.

Sixteen short years later,
She was falling for the senior football star.
Before you knew he was dropping passes,
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her.

The coach said ""Hey son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
Daddy said ""You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy you better tell her goodbye"".

Chorus
But now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful,
wonderful, perfect All-American...

And when they got married
and decided to have one of their own,
She said ""Be honest, tell me what do you want?""
And he said ""Honey, you oughta know...
Sweet, little, beautiful... one just like you.
Oh a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American...""

Now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful,
wonderful, perfect All-American Girl.

Of a beach towel in a spring break town

Through the speakers all night long

In a pair of oh my blue eyes

It's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway

And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that we knew
ain't nothing like it used to be

And the days got sold to the grid and the game

And you're all alone
I got the good stuff with me
Can you hear that song?
It just came on, girl

I can tell that you're feelin' it
I see the words runnin off your lips
And you're crazy cool
Same night, same spot
Don't it look like 've got some good timing?

[Chorus:]
Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yea
No, I don't think it's coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying, see you smiling
Baby ain't it crazy? We got good timing

Look up to that sky girl
It's a full moon night
You just broke up with somebody
Baby so did I
Just the other night, girl

Can you believe what time it is?
11: 11, let's make a wish
We're gonna have a night we'll never forget
And it ain't over yet
Girl we got some good timing

Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yea
No, I don't think it's coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying, see you smiling
Baby ain't it crazy? We got good timing

It used to be the only luck I had was a day late dollar short, always bad
And then I saw your face and it all changed up
Baby just like that
It's alright
Right on the money, on the spot
Girl we got some good timing

It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend
At least we didn't intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
There's a hickie or a bruise

And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale

Glass on the side now
I've been sat with you
For most of the night

Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be my lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Louder
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days

Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray

I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know that she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep
If anybody find out
I meant to drive home
But I drank all of it now
Not sober enough, we just sat on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Oh no

Sing

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

[chorus]
Cause when you're fifteen
And somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like
There's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on you're very first date
And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room
When the night ends
When the night ends

[chorus]
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[chorus]
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen,
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Carved my name into his leather seats

Slashed a hole in all four tires

And I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how
To turn it up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising

Haven't felt it for a lifetime

Oh up up all night long

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I don't know where I'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
And I could do this for a lifetime

I heard a funny noise
Whet out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a flux capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah yeah... he said

(Chorus)
I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great granddaughter
Is doing fine

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boybands and another one and another
And another one
Girls there with round hair like star wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah yeah... he said

I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great granddaughter
Is doing fine

Maybe we'll make something

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working down the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far,
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.

You see my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like this
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did.

You've got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We have got to make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You still ain't got a job

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of white snake’s car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright

And who’s the other guy singing in Van Halen

In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an All Star, get your game on - go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star, get the show on - get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me?
Cause one second it was perfect

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into you in the eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realized you love yourself
More than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends
That I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sittin' here, plannin'
my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From goin' out with all of
your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you
How sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

And if you're missin' me
You better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here
Would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

You never let me drive

164,Unguarded,1985,amy grant,False,Find A Way,"You tell me your friends are distant,
You tell me your man's untrue,
You tell me that you've been walked on,
And how you feel abused.

So you stand here an angry young woman,
Taking all the pain to heart.
I hear you saying that you want to see changes,
But you don't know how to start.

Chorus:
Love will find a way, (How do you know?)
Love will find a way, (How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see the past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way.
I know that
Love will find a way, (A way to go.)
Love can make a way, (Only love can know.)
Leave behind the doubt;
Love's the only out;
Love will surely find a way.

I know this life is a strange thing.
I can't answer all the why's.
Tragedy always finds me,
Taken again by surprise.

I could stand here an angry young woman,
Taking all the pain to heart.
But I know that love can bring changes,
And so we've got to move on.

(Repeat Chorus)

If our God His Son not sparing
Came to rescue you,
Is there any circumstance
That He can't see you through?

And I loved you every mile you drove away

166,x (Deluxe Edition),2014-06-21,ed sheeran,False,Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late Am
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day

Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows

She's poppin' right out of the south georgia water
Thought, ""oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so i walked up and said.

I looked at her and she looked at me
And i turned on those kc lights and drove all night
'cause it felt so right, her and i, man we felt so right.

Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart

Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet

And watches what he eats

And his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me

Still lookin' at your Instagram

Drinks beer, but has a six pack

In winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gang sign
Says ""Tune, boydem light up the room! ""

Eatin' a packet of crisps
But you will never find you cheatin'

We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet

Chorus:
Oh, play me some mountain music, like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river to a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn.
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreamin' again.

Chorus

Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man.
Spend the day bein' lazy, just bein' nature's friend.
Climb a long tall hick'ry. Bend it over, ""skinnin' cats.""
Playin' baseball with chert rocks, usin' sawmill slabs for bats.

Bridge:
Play some back-home, come-on music that comes from the heart.
Play something with lots of feelin', 'cause that's where music has to start

Oh, play me some mountain music, like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river to a Cajun hideaway, hey hey.

A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

So I settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone

Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'

To try their brand of barbecue

somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home

somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
that's rollin' on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might'a seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures

Mr. Play it Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
""Well, isn't this nice.""
And isn't it ironic ... don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures

Well life has a funny way
of sneaking up on you
when you think everything's okay
and everything's going right
And life has a funny way
of helping you out
when you think everything's gone wrong
and everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic... don't you think
A little too ironic.. and yeah I really do think...

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid

Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had
Don't that sh-t make you mad
They treat you like a slave, with chains all on your soul,
And put whips up on your back,
They be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats than get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glittering may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up, when times are hard you stand up
L-U-P the man, cause a brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us they'll never slow my plans up!

One in the air for the people that ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids who don't wanna be there
None for the n-ggas trying to hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids thats living in the ghetto
That the N-ggas holdin back that the World is theirs!
Yeah yeah, the World is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the World
Now I'm on a World tour
I will give up everything, even start a world war

On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse that I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all,

Love will scar your makeup
Lip sticks to me, so now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But the house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So shall we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to

There may be other people like us,
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light us,
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
I'm here to applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I? Should I?

So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched
To catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back
Like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick
And she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susan""

'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt
But what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you
Like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water

Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe

Been a lover, been a cheat

198,All The Right Reasons,2005-09-26,nickelback,False,Photograph,"Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if It's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your Bm, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, met her at Guy's in the Second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran

Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling

But nothing's greater
Than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

We got nothing figured out

The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, but what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things: to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same...
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance

Missing him was dark grey, all alone

But loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words

'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

A simple complication, miscommunication
Has lead to fallout

And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

How'd we end up this way?
Se me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me

How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

But I will lay my armor down

And kissing in the rain

I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush

232,Speak Now,2010-10-25,taylor swift,False,Dear John,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when
they said: Run as fast as you can

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by
Your dark twisted games when I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break or fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the candlelight shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders

Won't let no one break your heart

And you're mortified your mama's dropping you off
At 14, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your
PJs getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up

Nothing's ever left you scared
Even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be

And you still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition
At my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'Cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
In a twin size bed
And your mother's telling stories
'Bout you on the Tee Ball team
You tell me about your past
Thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there

Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here

I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
When you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again and I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

Until I forgot all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day

The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
You know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history, and you're getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win

We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah
Oh

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair

We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger,
But we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

Do you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down

And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused
Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity
And got the hell out

And time is taking a sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling they all look like me

We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us, then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together

Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided

To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying

Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying
Baby, I did too
But when the sun came up
I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up
You were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh

To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles;
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you.""

Come back for more.

Is on the other side of the door.

Sittin' here, alone.
Going through the photographs,
Staring at the phone.
I keep going back over
Things we both said.
And I remember the slammin' door,
And all the things that I misread.
Baby you know everything,
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left, I wanted you to
Chase after me?

With the little white lies.

Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back

Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough

Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
Moonlight reflects the chain on your neck

He says ""look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch and you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, the silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word

For once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face

Pauses, then says, ""you're my best friend""
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, the silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snowglobe round and round
And he keeps a picture of you
In his office downtown

And you understand now why
They lost their minds, and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life
Trying to put it into words

I said I don't want to part this earth
If I got to do it solo

(Verse 1)
See how we used to be a team
Running the streets
Ya we was living out our dream, ohh
You used to be my rider
I was your provider
Now we separated in two
Oh we was burning up the block
And everybody know when we step in the spot, ohh
See, we was like the dynamic duo
I'd never thought that you'd go back, but you did
You did

(Pre-Chorus)
Oh baby you left and sailed away alone

With nowhere to get home

Put us together
And you offered it the rewind

Now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again

Didn't know I was from the Virgin Islands or the U.K.
See, we was on the way to the platinum and gold
Never thought youd go back, but you did

Be so blind

We drifted apart

With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am

What your love means to me

Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near

Just remember to always think twice

Only brings the exasperation

Smell the desperation

And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser
DJ play another

only mad chicks ride in my whips

give it to me now nice and easy
since I moved up like George and Wheezy
cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em
would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum
never see Will attackin' 'em
rather play ball with Shaq and um,

Wear high heels when she excersizes

Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams

Her brother is a fine mediator for the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home and rip on the President

Pulls her hair back as she screams

You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Chorus:

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Verse 2:

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'ma scoot me somethin hot
In this south-sea merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas, with the hot mommies
Screamin (Aii poppy)
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your door
We flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gotsta plead the fifth

Chorus

Verse 3:

Don't get me wrong, Shytown got it goin on
An New York is the city that we know don't sleep
An we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mierda, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on southbeach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, evr'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home

It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad

You don't have to be afraid of what you are.
There's an answer, if you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know will melt away.

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.

It's a long road, when you face the world alone.
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold.
You can find love, if you search within yourself,
And the emptiness you felt will disappear.

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow.
But don't let anyone, take them away- ay ay.
Hold on, there will be tomorrow.
In time, you'll find the way.

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,

This ain't no disco
This ain't no country club either,
This is L.A.

“All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die”
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon , 'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

At twenty-three on the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe-is-me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity
I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all I can take and
Exploding seems like a definite possibility to me

So pardon me while I burst into flames

And its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me

And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, ""I can relate""
'Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication
As a welcome vacation from the burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D
But thinking so much differently

So pardon me while I burst into flames

Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights
And put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser
And the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches,
Sleep on the love-seat
Someone keeps sayin'
I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding
And a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation
And a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face
With some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps
And burnin' down the trailer park

And the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows
And the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
Slap the turkey-neck
And it's hangin' from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beef
For the body for the hate

People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
Niggaz, take off your coats ladies, act liike gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo
Luticrous, we speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo
On my never endin quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, cuz we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm buggin out, so let me get back cuz I'm wettin niggaz
So run and tell the others cuz we are the brothas
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

Phife:
Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was bustin rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case
I have a quest to have the mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never comin less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back , relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's the dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can the steps
I roll with Shaheed and the brotha Abstract
Niggaz know the time when the Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin here
Make somethin deffer, take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

My mind is racing faster every minute
What could I do more
Yeah I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles but I can't quit
And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away

Controlling everything in sight
Feeling weak I don't feel right
Telling me I have to change
Telling me to act my age
But if all that I can do
Is just sit and watch time go
Then i'll have to say good-bye
Life's too short to watch it fly
So watch it fly

So here I am growing older all the time
Looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind

So here I am, doing everything I can

You've got to trust your instinct
And let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star
'Cause that's your best bet

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
We come with the funky style
That gets us known for the show
And we'll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so
And fuck the naysayers cause they don't mean a thing
'Cause this is what style we bring

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what may come to shine
The dream will always be mine

All mixed up you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing
But the first could be the last so just get off your ass
All mixed up you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing
But you know this will pass so just get off your ass

You've got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star
'Cause that's your best bet

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
Sick sick bit got to have it
Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits
Sick sick bit just can't quit
Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what will come to shine
The dream will always be mine

You make me nervous throat dry
My brain is empty don't know why
But I saw you doing something
Which is really truly nothing
But you could bust me out all day

Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do
Many moons since first I saw you

Why did I try when I saw it was so

And when the car broke down they started walking
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

And it's always summer they'll never get cold

They'll never get old and gray

Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine it springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky

To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry

And we drive

Now that I have found someone

Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

I pace around the parking lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for

Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

It showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son it's time to tell the truth,"" and

Cause I was tired of lyin'

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment we're alone

Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you

To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We Belong to the thunder
We Belong to the sound of the words

Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We Belong, We Belong

When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing,
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
You'd guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here cause baby

Singing to me ""If You Think You're Lonely Now""
Wait a minute this is too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I Only Think Of You"" and it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby

In a barbecue joint in Tennessee.
When this old boy walked in
an he sat right down next to me.
I could tell he'd been through some hard times.
There were tear stains on his old shirt.
And he said ""You wanna know wat you get
When you play a country song backwards?""

You get your house back,
you get your dog back,
you get your best friend Jack back.
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first & second wifes back.
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling
and a diamond ring
You get your farm and the barn and the boat and the harley,
First night in jail with charley.
It sounds a little crazy,a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards.

Well I never heard it said quite like that.
It hit me in the face cause that's where i'm at.
I almost fell flat out on the floor.
He said""Wait a minute!That's not all there's even more.""

You get your mind back and your nerves back.
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
you get your life back
Get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV
DVD and a washing machine
You get your pond and the lawn and the bail and the mower
You go back where you don't know 'er
It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards

We sat there and shot the bull about how it would be
If we turned it all around and changed this

Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ridin' my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo!

Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me

Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are there own prison bars like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

Yeah I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night as the
summer drew to an end
They couldn't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Because my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar and I don't know if it's her or the rum

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today

Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from the lake
It's where all the muchachas they call me ""big poppa"" when I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pass me the Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play

Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
You got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay

With my ass in a lawn chair
And toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today

Looking like a model
Magazine figure
She was shaped like a bottle
Long straight hair
She was fly as a bird
First time ever
I was lost for words
Felt so right
Just couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight
If that exists at all
I couldn't move
Felt like I was stuck
And then baby girl looked up

And I said

Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spent time with you?

She knows she's got it
Came from the city so she loves to party
The JT song make her move that body
She's dancing all night long
I can tell that she was a wild one
That's why I was shy at first
But I finally worked up the nerve

Start swimming over here and ride my wave
'Cause I see that you party like there's no tomorrow

I got the keys
So jump in my car
Sit back, relax

Drove me around in the back of that truck

How â€˜bout a little test-drive, down by the lake?

We can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now whataâ€™ ya say? Girl I can hardly wait-
To get a little mud on the tires

Cause itâ€™s a good night, to be out there soakinâ€™ up the moonlight
Steak out a little piece of shoreline, I got the perfect place in mind
Itâ€™s in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
Gotta get a little mud on the tires

Moonlight on a duck vine, catfish on a trout line
Sun sets about nine, this time of year
We can throw a blanket down, crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear
Tell ya what we need to do, grab a sleepinâ€™ bag or two
And build us a little campfire
Then with a little luck, we might just get stuck

And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it'd be good for me
I want a cool chick that'll cook for me
But'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want and she'll do it with me

I just want a little bit of everything

Now I don't need a garage full of cars
But I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I'll smoke ‘em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don't need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ole room
Still feels lonely when it's just you
Yes it does

Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she ain't a foolin me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chuggin along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

We ride back and forth until we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weeny ride before I take her home

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chuggin along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan

But if it runs like a Deere man her eyes light up

Written by David Kent & Kirsti Manna
Produced by Bobby Braddock


She left without leavin' a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got

If you're callin' 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got somethin' to sell, you're wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone,
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin, I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days, and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say,
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. If this is Austin, I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evenin'
And this is what he heard

If you're callin' 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong
And by the way, boy, this is no machine you're talkin' to
Can't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you

I still love you

She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rearview mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95

Lord I'm on fire they think that I'm satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one
And you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'ma shoot you

[Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town Lax, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1]
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town Lax, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town Lax, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?

That You would have reached down
And wiped our tears away
Stepped in and saved the day
But once again, I say ""Amen""

As the thunder rolls
I barely hear You whisper through the rain
""I'm with you""
And as Your mercy falls
I raise my hands and praise the God
Who gives and takes away

Chorus:
I'll praise You in this storm
And I will lift my hands
For you are who you are
No matter where I am
Every tear I've cried
You hold in Your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise you in this storm

I remember when
I stumbled in the wind
You heard my cry You raised me up again
My strength is almost gone
How can I carry on
If I can't find You

Where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord

464,Casting Crowns,2003-10-07,casting crowns,False,If We Are The Body,"It´s crowded in worship today
As she slips in trying to fade into the faces
The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than
they know
Farther than they know

Chorus
But if we are the body
Why aren´t His arms reaching?
Why aren´t His hands healing?
Why aren´t His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren´t His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?
There is a way.

A traveler is far away from home
He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row
The weight of their judgmental glances
Tells him that his chances are better out on the road

Jesus paid much too high a price
For us to pick and choose who should come
And we are the body of Christ

Jesus is the way

Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak

From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines

There's no room
No space to rent in this town

You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination

You love this town

You've been all over
And it's been all over you

See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

Cause our minds change, on what we think is good

But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music

And buy me a star on the boulevard

But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres
Singin' songs of station to station
And Alderaan's not far away

Says she lives by no one's law
Ran my pride through a big chainsaw
Have you heard of D. B. Cooper?
I got pulled over by an old state trooper
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She cut my face with a razor blade

Yeah, I screamed out in fury
Yeah, but my cries were not heard
Yeah, the judge and the jury

I met a girl, her name was Jade
She got a brand new man and they got engaged
The wedding's gon' be on a big green hill
They hope it won't rain but it probably will
The man, he was a football star
He broke his knee, now he sells cars
Only so much that words can do
Love was blind, but they cured that, too
You know, Gandhi has a son our age
He said the freedom thing's just one big cage

Big cigar in an oak board room
We got an idea and we think it's great
Said it was too much so we're gonna try eight

And full of life and full of love

Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Cause with your hand in my hand
And a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
Staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

Cause with your hand in my hand
And a pocket full of soul

I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.

I felt a little fear upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking.
When the big black horse said ""look this way, hey lady, Will you marry me?""

But I said no, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours,
So it stopped it dead for a beat or two.
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,
and it won't forgive me after all these years

So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

But it said no, no, no,no-no-no

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cuddle woes away
Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
There over, here under
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

Le do lo le lo le, Le do lo le lo le
At your feet...I'm at your feet

Whenever, Wherever

I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear

You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal my dear

Think out loud, say it again

That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

Whenever, wherever

And from the ground I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm about
Tryin to get so much I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like you're eating Paul Cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't gotta Benz, no just a Honda
But try to get my money like an Anaconda,

Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream

Shut up bitch and ride this dick
I'm just playin' let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes, and alcohol
Hey, don't forget it when I'm wreckin' it
Etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit
I'm Flyer than a pelican
Young fresh but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm actin' like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in

It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoeing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme

my mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck, I'm sure as shit
by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul
the soul impossibly
A moment's silence
when my baby puts her mouth on
Me and my babe relaxin' catching manic rhapsody
All reason flown
as God looks on in abject apathy
A swollen Lord that measly a prayer
in perfect parody
A moment's silence
when my baby puts her mouth on me

When the meaning's gone, there is clarity
And the reason comes
in the common tongue of your lovin' me
And it's easy, darling, I need a remedy
And the reason comes
in the common tongue of your lovin' me

What yields the need for those
who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the sin
we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed
is pure authority
This moment's silence
when my baby puts her mouth on me

Since it's all been gone, to its reckoning
Then the reason comes
in the common tongue of your lovin' me
Be thankful, Son, now we lovingly
Let the reason come
to the common tongue of your lovin' me

Desert and ocean

So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do
You'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fucking tread the ground I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder
And harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better
You never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow
And writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that have all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up

So if you're beating death then raise your hand but shut up if you're not

The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard

Yesterday I thought I saw
Your shadow running round
It's funny how things never change
In this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say
The first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children
Playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching
I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met
He's got his arms around you
It's so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say
The first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children
Playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth

You still make me nervous
When you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive
When I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it's wrong
That I can't move on

Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah

Fluffed the pillows, made the beds
Stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive
Then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

A life with love is a life that's been lived

Are you holding back

Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush aint going away, going away

Has it ever crossed your mind

In a drawer under the mirror
Filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had
I can't pretend that I don't miss you
Every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
Lost in the tide
I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise

Can't let memories become the death of me

So many different flavors
So many shapes and sizes
You coming with me and you going where I am
No surprises, I put it all on the table for you
Nothing is too taboo, I'm ready, willing to give you everything

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
Trying to find a shorty to hold me down

They say to get a New York girl
Then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard there ain't nothing like the Cali girls
But you better have a lot of cash
And I know there ain't nothing like the A-Town girl
Cuz they know how to show you love
And no matter where I go
I gotta let them know
That this song here is about you

See I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
It's dealing on these pretty gals
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile, girl
Tells me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

Tell me is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?

They say, to get a MIA girl
Then you gotta have a lot of swag
I heard, to get a Down South Bell
Then you gotta ride a Cadillac
I know, ain't like a London girl
Cuz they know how to party up

And no matter where I go, I gotta let you know
That this song here is about you

I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
It's dealing on these pretty gals
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile, girl

[Travie McCoy]
I'm so indecisive
Trying to find a pretty girl that these shoes go nice with
Been around the world and back, got a I4 and girls in black
But I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips
Just make sure you need my heart how you found it
You can keep the key but the lock is around me
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one

Cause now I'm the one that's hurting yeah

I swear I never would've cross that line

Why am I doing this to myself
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no

It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Who you are, who you are, who you are

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try, the less it's working
Cause everything inside me screams:

694,Born This Way (International Special Edition Version),2011-05-23,lady gaga,False,Born This Way,"""This is the manifesto of Mother Monster
On Goat, a government-owned alien territory and space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite
It was infinite
As the womb slumbered
And the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life
is not temporal
It is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bares no prejudice
No judgement, but boundless freedom
But on that same day
As the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place
The birth of evil
And as she herself split into two
Rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of joice began its dance
It seems easy to imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered
How can I protect something so perfect without evil? ""

It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars

She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

'There's nothin wrong with lovin who you are'
She said, 'cause he made you perfect, babe'

'So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say'

I'm beautiful in my way
'cause god makes no mistakes

Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth

In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth

A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M (hey hey hey)
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (love needs faith)

Hide behind that baby face

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall

Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia, but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah, yeah)

Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in

A likely story, but leave a message

Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you please just let me be

I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and its effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

The powers have called me away
Another time
To carry the colors again
My motivation
An oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor
Of coming back home again
No explanation
Will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation
And now my unfortunate friend
You will discover
A war you're unable to win

I'll have you know
That I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side
A terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

Another reason
Another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered
Now, for me to light
My dedication
To all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders
With not a regret
My declaration
Embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder
Of how it began
No hesitation
When I am commanding to strike
You need to know
That you're in for the fight of your life

You will be shown
How I've become

Tribute

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said

""Play the best song in the world
or I'll eat your soul. "" (soul)

Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other
and we each said... ""Okay. ""

And we played the first thing
that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The Best Song in the World
it was The Best Song in the World

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Needless to say, the beast was stunned
Whip-crack went his Whoopy tail
And the beast was done
He asked us: "" (snort) Be you angels? ""
And we said, ""Nay. We are but men. ""
Rock!
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah-ah
Ohh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!

This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no

It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
It was the best muthafuckin' song
the greatest song in the world

And the peculiar thing is this my friends
the song we sang on that fateful night
it didn't actually sound
anything like this song

I guess it's not that bad

My heart is beating from me
I'm standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no sign of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure what is your pain?
Do you dream to much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
In the crowd of pain.
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says ""we're fucked up""
But we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame

Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
Is my own private suicide

[Part II: East 12th St.]

Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th st.
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world
And he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough
And he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away
I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
Just wanna be free
Is there a possibility
Get me out of here right now, right
This life like dream ain't for me

[Part III: Nobody likes you!]

I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee
And you're still not here
Dreaming of a song
But something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone
'Cause noone's here
Left me here alone
And I should've stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee
I'm thinking (where'd you go?)
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
(Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you

Jeez...ha...
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'
In over 22 days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case


[Part V: We're Coming Home Again]
HEY!
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns
are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning
Round and round
Out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We're the ones going

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touched ground
We're back in barrio
And to you and me, that's jingle town

With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And a spoon up your nose
When you wake up in the morning with you head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitching to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you?
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you?

You had to have the last word last night
You know what everything's about
You had to have the white hot spot light
You had to be a big shot last night

And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And with the story of your latest success
You kept them so entertained
But not you just don't remember all the things you
said
And you're not sure that you wanna know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own?
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky

Hand out some beat downs
Cold runna train on punk ho's that
Think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall
And the business that burned us all
See through the news and views that twist reality
Enough
I call the bluff

Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

Impulsive don't ask wild wonder

fast reflexes on constant alert
from the constant hurt that seems limitless
with no dropping pressure

Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'til they see your brake
They can't conceal the hate
That consumes you
I'm the reason why you flipped your soosa

Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days digit
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
mine's from a canteen

At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life
it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert
with my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker with the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

And it breaks my heart to say

Your eyes have wondered off
To something
Distant, cold and gray

I guess you didn't see it coming
Someones got use to slumming
Dreamin' of the golden years
I see you had to change careers

Far away
But we both know it's somewhere

I saw you on the back page of
Some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes said
Nothing short of love for pay

I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers

Not today
Send a message to her
A message that I'm coming
I'm coming to persue her

Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I got you ten times over
I'll chase you down till your dead

I saw you on the t.v. station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Now dusted with decay

What happened to the funny papers
Smilling was your money maker
Somone oughta situate her
Find a way to educate her

All the way
It's time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
So never mind what I do

Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I'm in my soul bed country
And I left it all for your head

I saw you in the churchyard
There was no time to exchange
You were getting married and
It felt so very strange

I guess I didn't see you coming
Now I guess it's me whos bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears

Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get use to

God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old

Like I told you I'm in for the long, long


Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about in God we trust
Some things slide but this is a must

Like I told you there is a time for finding out


People try to tell me what not to do
They shouldn't make it with a younger girl
And
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well

Like I told you be careful what your asking for


Chours

Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
Hey sister judas
Even you never had my back


She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude but I just didn't care
Had to find out these moments of air
And Stevie said all is fair

Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really really wanted to say
And
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to flee
And

Like I told you there is more than meets the eye


Chorus

Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
I said hey sister judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl you know how to bring the pain

Like I told you I'd do it all again

We wrote a prelude, to our own fairy tale
and bought a parachute, at a church rummage sale
and with a 'mean' sewing machine, and miles of thread
we sowed the day above LA in navy and red
we wound a race track, through your moms kitchen
chairs
and fought the shadows back, down your dark basement stairs
I lit a match then let it catch, to light up the room
and then you yelled as we beyelled an old maroon hot air balloon

[Chorus]
I'll be out of my mind, and you'll be out of ideas
pretty soon
so let`s spend, the afternoon in a cold hot air
balloon
leave your jacket behind, lean out and touch the
treetops over town
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down

[Verse 2]
We drank the great lakes, like cold lemonade
And both got stomach aches, sprawled out in the shade
so bored to death you held your breath, and I tried not to yawn
you made my frown turn upside down, and now my worries are gone

And I lie awake I miss you,
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere.
Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly,
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear,
Cause I wish you were here.

I'll watch the night turn light blue,
But it's not the same without you,
Because it takes two to whisper quietly,
The silence isn't so bad,
Till I look at my hands and feel sad,
Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly.

I'll find repose in new ways,
Though I haven't slept in two days,
Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone.
But drenched in Vanilla twilight,
I'll sit on the front porch all night,
Waist deep in thought because when I think of you.
I don't feel so alone.
I don't feel so alone.
I don't feel so alone.

As many times as I blink I'll think of you...
tonight.
I'll think of you tonight.

And heavy wings grow lighter,
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again.

806,Ocean Eyes (Deluxe Version),2009-01-01,owl city,False,The Saltwater Room,"I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay on the shore
Staring up at the plans that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold

So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently
Before you happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground

All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell with your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights
I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love, all the time?

My head is an animal.
And once there was an animal,
It had a son that mowed the lawn.
The son was an ok guy,
They had a pet dragonfly.
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say.

Her dirty paws and furry coat,
She ran down the forest slope.
The forest of talking trees,
They used to sing about the birds and the bees.

The bees had declared a war,
The sky wasn't big enough for them all.
The birds, they got help from below,
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow.

So for a while things were cold,
They were scared down in their holes.
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines.
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men.
And that's how the story goes,
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws.",en,0.12359550561797752,0.1616574983752987,0.5806451612903226,0.2894736842105263,0.6354546401416519,0.2727272727272727,0.727396859455769,1.0,0.026882914907798275,0.11031543189241955,0.013663967611336033,0.03770919365355358,0.10430602006688963,0.38385834275766545,0.75

In my insecure condition
My pregnant mind is fat full with envy again

Love to think that you couldn't love another

Wanted and adored by attractive women
Bountiful selection at your discretion
I know I'm diving into my own destruction

So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?
I don't fit in so why do you want me?

Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug

There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide

Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision

With the tank tops and the flirty words

With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you?ll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I?m still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

It distorts my vision, it closes my eyes
Attracts filthy flies and pollutes in the skies
Sucks up our lives and proliferates lies
Trapped in a box

Trapped in a box, four walls as sky
Got a screen for a window about two feet wide
My mind rides and slides as my circuits are fried
No room for thought, use the box as my guide
Trapped in a box

Trapped in a box
Watch the world as it flocks
To life's paradox
We're all trapped in a box

Trapped in a box I'm not alone
I know of others with a box as their home
Light only enters froma crack or a hole
This is not enough for a human to grow
Trapped in a box

(Repeat Chorus)

Always wanting a different view
Instant gratification for you
Reality gone in a single click
Just hope that that switch won't stick

Trapped in a box my life becomes void
All I thought for myself is now destroyed
Controlling my mind, what to eat, what to buy
Subliminal rules: how to live, how to die

We were cool back in high school
Ooh I really liked you,
Must have been your attitude.

In and out of my mind.

I keep comin back to you.

You're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice.

That's why you keep on runnin

It's not hard to know why
I keep comin back to you.

For you not to leave me now.

Not to make you my wifey,
Man they was putting you down.
And now they see we rollin,

They don't wanna come around.

955,Dark Horse,2008-10-28,nickelback,False,If Today Was Your Last Day,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned
Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less travelled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
If today was your last day

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause
There's no second try
So live like you're never livin twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make it up by mending a broken heart
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?

963,Biz's Baddest Beats: The Best of Biz Markie,1994-08-07,biz markie,False,Just a Friend,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and gues who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?""
she said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man,"" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some undderstanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I ccalled her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again
I said, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I as on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrrived in front of the dormitory
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth,
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

1006,The Book Of Secrets,1997,loreena mckennitt,False,The Mummers' Dance,"When in the springtime of the year
When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak, and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair

When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year

The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone

A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
It is a sprout well budded out
The work of Our Lord's hand""

about forgetting yourself for a while
and the piano's this melancholy sound check
to her smile
And that white dress she's wearing
you haven't seen her
for a while

But you know that she's watching
she's laughing, she's turning
she's holding her tonic like a crux
The room suddenly spinning
she walks up and asks how you are
so you can smell her perfume
you can see her lying naked in your arms

And so there's a change...
in your emotions
and all of these memories come rushing
like feral waves to your mind
of the curl of your bodies
like two perfect circles entwined
and you feel hopeless, and homeless
and lost in the haze
of the wine

Then she leaves...
with someone you don't know
but she makes sure you saw her
she looks right at you and bolts
As she walks out the door
your blood boiling
your stomach in ropes
and when your friends say ""what is it?""
you look like you've seen a ghost

Then you walk...
under the streetlights
and you're too drunk to notice
that everyone is staring at you
and you so care what you look like

My weakness is that I care too much
My scars remind me that the past is real

Drunk and I'm feeling down
and I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
and I can't help to fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

Chorus
I tear my heart open, I sow myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
Our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
A kiss will only advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

Chorus

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
and I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
and I tried to grab your hand
and I left my heart open
but you didn't understand
but you didn't understand
Go fix yourself!!

I can't help you fix yourself

I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life

Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me.""

Use a wooden chair.""

With time to kill
I borrowed Jebbâ€™s rifle
And sat on a hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim

My brotherâ€™s rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brotherâ€™s rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
Thatâ€™s where they found me
My head and my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in the chair
Explain to the court room
What went through you mind
And weâ€™ll ask the jury
What verdict they find

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

Up on a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And heâ€™d come to fetch me
To see what theyâ€™d done
And weâ€™d ride together
To kingdom come
I prayed for godâ€™s mercy
For soon Iâ€™d be dead

Could it be spring or fall

Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

I trashed my own house party cause nobody came.

But what would you expect with a conscience so small.

Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and,
Cutting people down is just a minor offence then,
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn.

Back packed and I don't give a shit about nothing.

But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing.
Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook,
You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book.

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love, I've been thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, standing out there alone
Oh A yearning, and it's real for me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere

In this whole world, what's fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love, I've been thinking of?

I will wait for it, I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love

Nosebleeds, palm trees, and tumbleweeds rustling
Outside, they say it's happy here, but it's depressing
Too many pretty faces catching my attention
So I look at them, remind myself in the smudged glass
""That pretty isn't everything, you punk ass""
Always hard to see past the surface, when it looks so perfect
But our eyes will disguise dirt on purpose, you listening?

I grew up here, under the sun
In grade school, I was the odd one, out of the bunch
And I don't mean I was the kid to eat bugs for lunch
I was the one who wasn't coming from where they're coming from
I speak poetically, and never pride my ignorance
But this California shit is rigorous
They say it's happy here, happiness is figurative
I'm happy 'cause of me, doesn't matter where I'm living

If the ocean was the devil, I'd be covered in hate
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame

I'm waking up underneath sheets, naked still sweating
Slept in late so everybody else is ready
My friend called up, he said
""Hurry up, buddy, it's almost sundown already. ""
So I hopped up, I went and washed up
I ate some pasta, then I gave my mom hugs
And then I thought, ""Uh, it's gonna be a pretty nice night. ""
But pretty isn't everything, right?

Golden state mind, I'm taking my time
Plain white shirt, and a skinny black tie
My top let down when I get picked up

But before you shoot, please warn us

When I'm finished

Brand new faith
And I'm ready for the camera's mention
And all I pay
And my money and my damn attention

Didn't get me the deal
Got me to feel
How you would hear my sentence

But the sunshine fades away

Everything's black
And white

You can see me when I wear my lenses
And all they say
Is I'm fake and I don't get offended

And when push comes to shove
Ill show enough
I didn't need to listen
When I'm finished

You're insane
What you said when I explain the game plan
Nothing's changed
Except a little more change in my hand

Now I don't mean to brag
Life was in fact
Non-witness shows of women
It's not finished

You could do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny
But the sunshine fades away

Everything's black
And white

You ended up with gold
But it started as a dream

Put some honey in my tea

now there's money in my jeans
I was broke now there's money in my jeans

Binds the world in a feeling all familiar
'Cause everybody owns the great ideas
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner

A tenner, up and out into New York
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers
And oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk
It's the modern road where folk are nice to Yoko

Every bone of rivet steel, each corner stone an anchor
Jenga jutts and rusty water tower, pillar-posted sign
Every painted lining battered, like a building in this town
Sings a life of proud endeavour
and the best that man can be

Me, I see a city and I hear a million voices
Planning, drilling, welding, carrying their fingers to the nub
Reaching down into the ground, stretching up into the sky
Why?
Because they can, they did and do
so you and I could live together

Oh my god, New York can talk
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers

The desire like a distant storm

out of feathers, out of bones.
We set fire to our homes,
walking barefoot in the snow.
Distant rhythm of the drum
as we drifted towards the storm.
Baby lion lost his teeth,
now they're swimming in the sea.

Troubled spirits on my chest
where they laid to rest.
The birds all left my tall friend
as your body hit the sand.
Million stars up in the sky
formed a tigers eye
that looked down on my face,
out of time and out of place.

So hold on,
hold on to what we are,
hold on to your heart.

Awaken by the sound
of a screaming owl.
Chasing leafs in the wind,
going where we've never been.

Said goodbye to you my friend,
as the fire spread.
All that's left are your bonesthat will soon sink like stones

So hold on,
hold on to what we are,

When the floes under our feet bled into the sea

You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

Strayed, above the highway aisle

3rd and lake, it burnt away the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled, far from the highway aisle

Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

And I just, in the processes through means to the end

To the spins between us

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe if I know all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give.

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

How can I love you?
How can I love you?
How can I love you?
How can I love you?
If you just don't talk to me, babe.

I flow through my act
There's a question: Is she needed?
And decide all the man I can ever be.
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this.

(Do you know?)

Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me.

Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused when I asked you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and surviours
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better
but the killer was a Coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad cause the quarter million on my necklace

You and I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop I was destined

For if and when we go ""above"", the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going ""under"" starts to take my wonder

The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car to the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading

Oh the glory that the lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

Oh the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

Oh the glory that the lord has made
And the complications when I see his face
In the morning in the window

Oh the glory when he took our place

The space where you used to be
Your head on my shoulder
All of the plans we made that never happened
Now your scent on my pillow's faded
At least you left me with something

There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me
I keep digging through our waste of time
But the picture's incomplete

There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me
I keep digging through our waste of time
But the picture's incomplete
'Cause I'm missing you
I miss you

Can't make sense of all of the pieces
Of my own delusions
Can't take all these memories
Don't know how to use them

There's a slick washed up onto the beach
I follow the traces
Finding clues in my pockets and opening boxes
And going places we went
Remember to forget
Thinking how it could been
I've turned all my sorrow into glass
It don't leave no shadow

There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me

A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled

Raised in an era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive

A worker of pride
My debt to the status quo

The scars on my hands
and the means to an end
is all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride
and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers
and lied through my teeth
the pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge
and I've thrown the bouquet
of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room
Wasting my time
and waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
The ""freedom to obey""

Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

But it's hard to sleep when your head's not in it
I've been restless
Cause you disappeared and that's all that's missing
The Earth is loose under my shoes
There's an angel
And he's shaped like you, and I thought I knew him
There's a window
And it's dark inside, but the light was in it
This can't be love if it hurts so much
I need to let go

I will survive and be the one who's stronger
I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it
Wild horses run in me

I remember
How we danced so close, I would stand on your feet
And the phone calls
That would last all night, they were lifeboats to me
Our fading scars just shooting stars
They're here, then go

I will survive and be the one who's stronger
I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it
Wild horses run in me

A human hurts, forgets how strong they are
And they get lost along the way, hey
It's not giving up, it's letting go
And moving to a better place

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love

When you was just a young'un your looks was so precious
But now your grown up
So fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listening

Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else trippin

One minute I'm in Central Park.
Then, I'm down on Delancey Street.
Said, from the Bow'ry to St Mark's.
There's a syncopated beat. Right.

~*Pre-Chorus.*~

I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetwise.
I can improvise.
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetsmart.
I've got New York City heart.

~*Chorus.*~

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime.
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just be-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire.

~*Verse Two.*~

The rhythm of the city.
But once you get it down.
Said, then you can own this town.
You can wear the crown!

~*Chorus.*~

Why should I worry? Tell me.
Why should I care?
I Said, I may not have a dime. Oh!
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire.

~*Bridge.*~

Ev'rything goes.
Ev'rything fits.
They love me at the Chelsea!
They adore me at the Ritz!

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line.
I got street savoir faire.

Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton""
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done
to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' ""Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? ""

Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part

But honestly, I do it all again
Putting up with all the bullshit
it made me strong enough to do this

It used to bother me
Thought I could never leave?
After all that I've been through
nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighin' down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through

And I feel proud from who I am now

I love the woman that I became

1372,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967-12-27,leonard cohen,False,Suzanne,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river.
You can hear the boats go by,
You can spend the night beside her.
And you know she's half crazy,
But that's why you want to be there.
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China.
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover.

And you want to travel with her,
And you want to travel blind,
And you know she will trust you,
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.

Now Jesus was a sailor, when he walked opon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower.
And when he knew for certain, only drownding men could see him,
He said: ""All men shall be sailors then, until the sea shall free them.""
But he himself was broken
Long before the skys would open,
Foresaken, almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom, like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river.
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters.
And the sun pours down like honey on our Lady of the Harbor.
And she shows you where to look, among the garbage and the flowers.
There are heros in the seaweed,
There are children in the morning,
They are leaning out for love,
They will lean that way forever,
While Suzanne holds the mirror.

And you want to travel with her,
And you want to travel blind,
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

1374,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967-12-27,leonard cohen,False,Master Song,"I believe that you heard your master sing
when I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
that I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner wine and bread?

You met him at some temple, where
they take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
and he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
of all the kisses we put on some time before.

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
with a collar of leather and nails,
and he never once made you explain or talk
about all of the little details,
such as who had a word and who had a rock,
and who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
and it never stops not even when your master fails.

And he took you up in his aeroplane,
which he flew without any hands,
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
that drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
and, an ape with angel glands,
erased the final wisps of pain
with the music of rubber bands.

And now I hear your master sing,
you kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
that your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
my body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
your shirt is all undone.

And will you kneel beside this bed
that we polished so long ago,
before your master chose instead
to make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
and you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
before he made you go.

Then I think you're playing far too rough
for a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
to get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
who is tapping his foot to a tune,
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
let's say you came back some time too soon.

I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
and I taught him how you would long for me
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do.

I believe that you heard your master sing
while I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.

1375,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967-12-27,leonard cohen,False,The Stranger Song,"(from the album 'SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN')


It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender.

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.

And then leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger.

But now another stranger seems
to want you to ignore his dreams
as though they were the burden of some other
O you've seen that man before
his golden arm dispatching cards
but now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.

Ah you hate to see another tired man
lay down his hand
like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
you notice there's a highway
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder.

You tell him to come in sit down
but something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It's you my love, you who are the stranger.

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
we'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
to get me to the heart of this
or any other matter
When he talks like this
you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this,
you don't know what he's after.

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
upon the shore, beneath the bridge
that they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform
for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind ...

And leaning on your window sill ...

I told you when I came I was a stranger.

Without a cup of tea

That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep

Bodies deformed way beyond belief
Cast out from their concerned society
Flesh contorting day after day
Freak of the dark world is what the people say

Their lives decay before their eyes
There is no hope of cure
Among their own kind they live
A life that's so obscure
First an arm and then a leg
Deterioration grows
Rotting while they breathe - Death comes slow

Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to change
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take

Tuberculoid the most severe
Decay of the nerves comes fast
Sense of feeling soon to be gone
Life will never last

No hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away
Damage is done you feel no more pain
Bones decay deterioration grows
Origin of this horrid disease nobody knows

Their lives decay before their eyes
There is no hope of cure
Among their own kind they live
A life that's so obscure
First an arm and then a leg
Deterioration grows
Rotting while they breathe - Death comes slow

Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to changel
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take

When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?

We're words without a rhyme

In a time before the light.
In flames of death's eternal reign,
We ride towards the fight.

When the darkness has fallen down
and the times are tough alright
The sound of evil laughter,
Falls around the world tonight.

Fightin' hard, fightin' on for the steel,
Through the wastelands evermore.
The scattered souls will feel the hell,
bodies wasted on the shores.

On the blackest plains in hell's domain,
We watch them as they go.
In fire and pain, and once again we know.

So now we fly ever free,
We're free before the thunderstorm.
On towards the wilderness,
Our quest carries on.

Far beyond the sun down, far beyond the moonlight.
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls.

So far away we wait for the day,
For the lives all so wasted and gone.
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

As the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky.
They'll raise their hands
to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes.

Running back through the midmorning light,
there's a burning in my heart.
We're banished from a time in the fallen land,
To a life beyond the stars.

In your darkest dreams see to believe our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality.
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone.
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind,
Day after day this misery must go on.

So far away we wait for the day,
For the lives all so wasted and gone.
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

Whooaaaaa, Whoooaaaaa, Whooooaaaoooaaooo (x2)

Now here we stand with their blood on our hands.
We fought so hard, now can we understand.
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can.
For freedom of every man.

So far away we wait for the day,
For the lives all so wasted and gone.

Through the valleys of evil and torturing souls,
Night after night, for the glory we fight,
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old!

As the darkness surrounds us and the cries as they fall,
Fire burning steel, and the tyrants will kneel,
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory,
Pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands
Endless rise with the heroes before

Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day, for the demons we slay,
With the force of the dragon we will conquer them all!

With the ultimate glory will relentlessly crawl (?)

Raging from the darkness beyond

Fearing rise, with the heroes once more

Outside of the wasted and torn,
A land of tears still remains

Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,

And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

It's in your face but you can't grab it

It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame

You want it all but you can't have it

1515,Animals,1977-01-23,pink floyd,False,Dogs,"You got to be crazy
Gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes
And when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat
With your eyes closed
And then moving in silently
Down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder and harder
and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest that you've sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
Dragged down by the stone

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try
And shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable
And no-one had a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart
Everyone's a killer

another starry night like this

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally

and none of us prepared to die

The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

Deep in the land of the Rus'.

And the rhythm of the oars.

Constantly on guard.

We came under attack,
I received a deadly wound.
A spear was forced into my back
Still I fought on.

Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory

Now here I lay on the river bank
A long, long way from home
Life is pouring out of me
Soon I will be gone.

I tilt my head to the side
And think of those back home
I see the river rushing by
Like blood runs from my wound.

Here I lie on wet sand,
I will not make it home.
I clinch my sword in my hand,
Say farewell to those I love.

I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She dunt do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes,
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
It's all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
Overt your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
""Sorry love I'll have to turn you down""

He must be up to something
What are the chances sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
it doesn't stop in the winter, no
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town

Feed my envy with the fat ov lambs

With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more, more, more, more, more

But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed

Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair

A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain
A million times for you

I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
I'd give you all and have none, babe

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the Usa, the big Cia
The Bloods and The Crips and the Kkk

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate
then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)

Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?

Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin'
as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone

So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in
people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret
it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth
then you never know love

Where is the love (The love) ?
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds
Faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

Yo', whatever happened
to the values of humanity
Whatever happened
to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity

The blood runs free
The rain turns red

Is God dead?

Swimming in sorrow
They kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes you cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over? Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath
I transfer from reality into a living death
I empathize with enemies until the time is right
With God and satan at my side
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don?t need bread

Nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the good book said?
Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?

1573,Desire,1976-01-16,bob dylan,True,Hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops.""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson that's just the way things go.
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner
and he had a rap for the cops.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out,
they looked likemiddleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in,
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him,
lookin' for somebody to blame.
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter
that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white.""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure.""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail,

You'll be doin' society a favor.
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail.
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
And though they could not produce the gun,
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
The crime was murder ""one,"" guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell.
That's the story of the Hurricane,
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.",en,0.0898876404494382,0.42470758182714075,0.7634408602150538,0.4610983981693364,0.8218935527549213,0.0,0.6954549887837705,1.0,0.12463896911797377,0.04177601223682982,0.0,0.10780265159747882,0.7418478260869565,0.5355032593364423,0.75

They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide.
I live in another world where life and death are memorized,
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer,
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere.
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes,
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is.
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized,
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel,
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel.
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies,
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,

I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles
in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby
with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men
with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers
whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords
in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder,
it roared out a warnin',
Heard the roar of a wave
that could drown the whole world,
Heard one hundred drummers
whose hands were a-blazin',
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
Heard one person starve,
I heard many people laughin',
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man
who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
Where the people are many
and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley
meets the damp dirty prison,
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
And reflect it from the mountain
so all souls can see it,
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,

1578,Street-Legal,1978-06-15,bob dylan,False,Changing of the Guards,"Sixteen years,
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves.
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.

Fortune calls.
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.

The cold-blooded moon.
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.

They shaved her head.
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.

I stumbled to my feet.
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.

The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.

Gentlemen, he said,
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

Peace will come
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

Eine Gestalt lag auf dem Boden
so bâ€sartig, dab die Blumen um sie herum
verwelkten
eine dunkle Seele lag auf dem Boden
so kalt, dab alles Wasser sich in Eis verwabdelte
Ein Schatten fiel ï¢ber den Wald
als des Gestalts Seele dahinwelkte

ein Schatten der Krâ€žfte des Bâ€sen.

1586,Tomb Of The Mutilated,1992,cannibal corpse,False,Hammer Smashed Face,"There's something inside me
It's, it's coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold

Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding

Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in,
until brains seep in
through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me

Lifeless body, slouching dead lecherous abcess,
where you once had a head

Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again,
soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet,
eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse
as I crack your skull in half

Crushing, cranial, contents

Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

Suffer, and then you die

Torture, pulverized

At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me

Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue

Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture

Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter
Making boring people famous
Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters

We're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good Tv

Oh Mr. Man upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste
That we've made
Would you say? Please say
It was worth the seven days

Does he hang his head in all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the [?] stress
Like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static you show what's the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?

'Cause we're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, but don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created has made for damn good Tv

Oh, Mr. Man upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste
That we've made
Would you say? Please say
It was worth the seven days

Don't touch the remote
We'll be back in a moment
We are not hopeless
We are just coping
The mayhem is rolling
But it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent
Chaotic, I know it
But we're growing
Have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave us?

Oh, Mr. Man upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste
That we've made
Would you say? Please say

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless

(verse 1)
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind
when it Breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo. I
Mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we've got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

(chorus)
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless

(verse 2)
How could you be so dr. Evil
you bringin' out the side of Me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up 3 a. M. On the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I wont stop, I wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

(chorus)
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless

(verse 3)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you cant believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you cant make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night
