But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street
Right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me
While her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean
The Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs
Do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with
Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts
And then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me
Like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called
Was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice
Playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room
Swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome
And it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs
With the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio,
But it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
And all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've given you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man

My pride, my ego
My needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you
To walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up
The mess I made
And it haunts me
Every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Mm,too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you
Flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say
That I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably
Much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers,
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember
How much you loved to dance

I should've done

And me falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you hide away
And find your piece of mind with some indie record

9,Blowin' Your Mind!,1967-09,van morrison,False,Brown Eyed Girl,"Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in a hollow
Playin' a new game

Laughin' and a runnin' hey hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog
With our, our hearts a thumpin'
And you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

And what ever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Gone down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
Slippin' and a slidin'
All along the waterfall
With you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da (just like that)
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
La ti da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, you have grown

Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da

I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
But the worst's yet to come

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she? ""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

He's got a one hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
he says ""baby, is something wrong?""

I say nothin'
I was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song
and he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh,
the first date, man, I didn't kiss her and I should have
and when I got home
Before I said amen
askin' God if He could play it again

I was walkin' up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway
well on my way
to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said:

When I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

I see the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way
Through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin' you ""Please don't go""

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out
To the garden to see you
We keep quiet
Cause we were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

Cause you were Romeo
I was a Scarlett Letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
And I was beggin' you Please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say ""Yes""

Romeo save me
They're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
But it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say ""Yes""

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

Romeo save me
I've been feelin' so alone
I keep waiting for you
But you never come
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring

And said

Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you
And that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It's a Love Story

Better than anything I've ever had
Cause you're so damn beautiful read it

Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere

Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win
some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends

44,Say You Won't Let Go,2016-09-09,james arthur,False,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
Cause I played it cool when I
Was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise, till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so
hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out,
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me
but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win
some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and
you'll find love love love

Listen to the music of the moment
people dance and sing
We just one big family and
It's your God-forsaken right
to be loved love loved love loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking
my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just
to try to see it clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying
is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do,
our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and
you'll find that the sky is yours

The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore younger man's clothes""

La la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Chorus:
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As a smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davi who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As a businessman slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Chorus

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, de de da

Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
But the long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over

Do we have enough time to save this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April

Skating on thin ice

Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down

It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone gone tonight

The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside

Are the colors that I can't change

I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken
My heart is untamed, still

91,Carnival Ride,2007-10-23,carrie underwood,False,All-American Girl,"Since the day they got married,
He'd been praying for a little baby boy.
Someone he could take fishing,
Throw the football and be his pride and joy.

He could already see him holding that trophy,
Taking his team to state.
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket,
All those big dreams changed.

Chorus
And now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful,
wonderful, perfect All-American Girl.

Sixteen short years later,
She was falling for the senior football star.
Before you knew he was dropping passes,
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her.

The coach said ""Hey son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
Daddy said ""You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy you better tell her goodbye"".

Chorus
But now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful,
wonderful, perfect All-American...

And when they got married
and decided to have one of their own,
She said ""Be honest, tell me what do you want?""
And he said ""Honey, you oughta know...
Sweet, little, beautiful... one just like you.
Oh a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American...""

Now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful,
wonderful, perfect All-American Girl.

Jet trails cutting across the sky

Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow
Like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

Had the guns on the radio

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window
on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time
all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that we knew
ain't nothing like it used to be

Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grid and the game

And I just can't let it go, no

was out the left speaker

Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn!

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bars
So we hit the boulevards

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op

Glass on the side now
I've been sat with you
For most of the night

Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be my lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Louder
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days

Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray

I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know that she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep
If anybody find out
I meant to drive home
But I drank all of it now
Not sober enough, we just sat on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Oh no

Sing

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was
lyin' to myself

We were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery

No, they never get far, oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
Well, he was runnin' after us
I was screamin', ""go, go, go! ""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry
(we're both sorry)

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first old fashioned
We were cursed

We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switch to the other side
To the other si-I-I-I-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag
and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far

It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

[chorus]
Cause when you're fifteen
And somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like
There's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on you're very first date
And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room
When the night ends
When the night ends

[chorus]
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[chorus]
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen,
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

'Cause she can't shoot whiskey

With a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""

I heard a funny noise
Whet out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a flux capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah yeah... he said

(Chorus)
I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great granddaughter
Is doing fine

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boybands and another one and another
And another one
Girls there with round hair like star wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah yeah... he said

Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero we've got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working down the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far,
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.

You see my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like this
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did.

You've got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We have got to make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You've got a a fast car
And we go cruising entertain ourselves,
You still ain't got a job
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car

And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You've got a fast car
And I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar see more of your friends
Than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I've got no plans and I aint going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah

Know all of the things that make you who you are

In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an All Star, get your game on - go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star, get the show on - get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

You moved to West L.A or
New York or Santa Fe or
Wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you
'Cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed
And frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by-y-y-y
Just a shy guy,
Looking for
A 2-ply hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me
Everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by-y-y-y

On the other side to a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again so
Let's skip the ""how you've been"" and
Get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night
Was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed
And frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by-y-y-y

Looking for

Oh I swear to ya

This is not a drive by-y-y-y

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true, cause

156,x (Deluxe Edition),2014-06-21,ed sheeran,False,Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late Am
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day

Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.

Hey baby

Yeah, when i first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the south georgia water
Thought, ""oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so i walked up and said.

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.

She was sippin' on southern and singin' marshall tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"".

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And i turned on those kc lights and drove all night
'cause it felt so right, her and i, man we felt so right.

I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell i can't get you out of my head.

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet
And watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked
And his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram
And I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman

You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to

I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder
But I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack
I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors
In winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gang sign
Says ""Tune, boydem light up the room! ""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps
But you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club
Kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it
You can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved

But you act so differently

Radio spillin' from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin' on a branch by the river
That's a memory that'll get you when you look back

Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times,
while there's still time

Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party's at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And don't look back 'cause

Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my

Leans in for a kiss, she's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy

165,Playlist: The Very Best Of Alan Jackson,1991,alan jackson,False,Where I Come From,"Well I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears
'Round that Jersey Turnpike
When Barney stopped me with his gun
ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty ol' truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well i was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab and the lady aked me
How'd you like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it

Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

I was chasin' sun on 101
somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home
we like the girls that sing soprano

Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well I was headed home on 65
somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
that's rollin' on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might'a seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
and workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta back porch pickin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
Workin' hard to get to heaven

Starin' up at heaven

Let's say your baby's mad 'cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed from late last spring of you and her in florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head and looks at you and says ""ain't you good for anything? ""
And you say

Every week has a weekend by this time friday night
If you want a margarita
I'll get tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it
With a cold one in my other hand

I can stomp it with my boot
Punch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead
Yeah, I got this
I'll be crushin' it
Oh, I'll be crushin' it

That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom

175,+,2011-09-09,ed sheeran,False,Drunk,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse that I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all,

Love will scar your makeup
Lip sticks to me, so now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But the house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So shall we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to

There may be other people like us,
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light us,
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
I'm here to applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

176,Revival,2017-12-15,eminem,True,River (feat. Ed Sheeran),"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched
To catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back
Like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick
And she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susan""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand
Turned in two-night stand
He was calling so might scram
Now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt
But what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you
Like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh) , my name's (ooh)
Denver (ooh) , watch the river run
Call me (ooh) , call me (ooh)
River (ooh) , we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey! ""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe
That's why I made they came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
Well, I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie
To tell a unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

180,All The Right Reasons,2005-09-26,nickelback,False,Photograph,"Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if It's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your Bm, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

193,÷ (Deluxe),2017-03-03,ed sheeran,False,Nancy Mulligan,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said: ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, met her at Guy's in the Second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border

I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling

But nothing's greater
Than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there is a drawer of my things at your place
You learned my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You said we'd never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go out
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make you feel right
Lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby
Like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, but what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things: to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same...
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

A new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ended so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing
You'd never found out
That love could be that strong

Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody

I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh
A simple complication, miscommunication
Has lead to fallout
Too many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
And I don't know what to say

And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

How'd we end up this way?
Se me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me

I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh
I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how

But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I will lay my armor down

The jury's out, my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard.
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours.

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.
Lurking in the shadows with their lipgloss smiles,
But I don't care.
Cause right now you're mine.
And you'll say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard.

But this love is ours.

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in.
I'll fight their doubts and give you faith with this song for you

Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak.
And any snide remarks from my father
About your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,

And life makes love look hard.

So incredible and
All my single friends are jealous

And it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
And I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

And kissing in the rain
And it's 2 am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster
Kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing and I'm
Comfortable

212,Speak Now,2010-10-25,taylor swift,False,Dear John,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when
they said: Run as fast as you can

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by
Your dark twisted games when I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break or fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the candlelight shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""

And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'Cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
In a twin size bed
And your mother's telling stories
'Bout you on the Tee Ball team
You tell me about your past
Thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

Hey you called me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all all all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
When you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again and I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all

It's getting cold
I've got
My big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
The tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I forgot all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day

And I'll do anything to see it through

Oh

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair

We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger,
But we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me

Two A. M. riding in your truck
and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside til the morning light

We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time
when we walked down the aisle

Take me home where we met so many years before

Chasing fortune and fame

Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Now it's big black cars, and riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused
Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity
And got the hell out

Chose the rose garden over madison square

While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems
Like a perfect rhyme
Took off fast through the green light, go
Hey, skip the conversation and you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

Burnt toast, Sunday

For once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face

Pauses, then says, ""you're my best friend""

When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

(chorus)
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you have wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us
""Don't rush into things""
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better

In wonderland, in wonderland
In wonderland, in wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us
""Don't rush into things""
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you calm my fears
With with a Cheshire cat smile?

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody
Loses their mind

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better

In wonderland, in wonderland
In wonderland, in wonderland

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in wonderland
We both went mad

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever

Dreaming dreams with happy endings

In backyards winning battles with our wooden swords

Where everybody stands and keeps score

Be so blind

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

Turned night into day
I need you to stay

Stay away, don't you invade my home.

Don't come in - I'll only run and hide.

If he hears, he'll knock all day,
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay.
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health.
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
of being the one

And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice,
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)

She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

So if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?

It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that
When I drive myself my light is found

Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
I'll be there

Would you choose water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?

Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
I'll be there

First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly
Spend eternity

You have to be fulfilling all my dreams

I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me
And I end up unhappy

So before I do give myself to you
I have to know the truth

Her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

She smokes a pack a day
Oh, wait, that's me, but anyways
She doesn't care a thing about that hair
She thinks I'm beautiful

She never compromises
Loves babies and suprises
Wear high heels when she excersizes
Ain't that beautiful?
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mamma works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home and rip on the President
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And Everything seems cut and dry

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things it come along with

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Cos I, don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things it come along with
You make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong

304,Music Box,1993-08-31,mariah carey,False,Hero,"There's a hero, if you look inside your heart.
You don't have to be afraid of what you are.
There's an answer, if you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know will melt away.

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.

It's a long road, when you face the world alone.
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold.
You can find love, if you search within yourself,
And the emptiness you felt will disappear.

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow.
But don't let anyone, take them away- ay ay.
Hold on, there will be tomorrow.
In time, you'll find the way.

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside, because you know you can survive.

This ain't no disco
This ain't no country club either,
This is L.A.

“All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die”
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon , 'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun

Spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights
And put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser
And the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches,
Sleep on the love-seat
Someone keeps sayin'
I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding
And a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation
And a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face
With some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps
And burnin' down the trailer park

'Cuz one's got a weasel
And the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows
And the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
Slap the turkey-neck
And it's hangin' from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beef
For the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax
Fallin' on a termite

We come with the funky style
That gets us known for the show
And we'll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so
And fuck the naysayers cause they don't mean a thing
'Cause this is what style we bring

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what may come to shine
The dream will always be mine

All mixed up you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing
But the first could be the last so just get off your ass
All mixed up you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing
But you know this will pass so just get off your ass

You've got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
Sick sick bit got to have it
Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits
Sick sick bit just can't quit

This world is forcing me
To hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl, little ol' me
Don't let me out of your signt
I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh... I've had it up to here!

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons
For me to run and hide
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things
That I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl,
I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive
Late at night
I'm just a girl,
Guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare
With their eyes
I'm just a girl,
Take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh... I've had it up to here!
Oh... am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world...
That's all that you'll let me be!

I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb
Makes me worry some
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to
Is making me numb
I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become, is so burdensome
I'm just a girl, lucky me

Seemed a harmless little fuck
But we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and
Bit the recess ladies breast

Dropped wide open

Wooh can I get myself into

You make me wanna say
Meet my family, how is your family
Ooh, can we be a family?
And when I'm many years old and sitting next to you
And we'll remember when we said

I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing,
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
You'd guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here cause baby

Singing to me ""If You Think You're Lonely Now""
Wait a minute this is too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I Only Think Of You"" and it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby

That God blessed the broken road

I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you

There were tear stains on his old shirt.

When you play a country song backwards?""

You get your house back,
you get your dog back,
you get your best friend Jack back.
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first & second wifes back.
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling
and a diamond ring
You get your farm and the barn and the boat and the harley,
First night in jail with charley.
It sounds a little crazy,a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards.

Well I never heard it said quite like that.
It hit me in the face cause that's where i'm at.
I almost fell flat out on the floor.

Get your first real love back

359,Songs About Jane: 10th Anniversary Edition,2002,maroon 5,False,This Love,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me

But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don't have to throw back
Your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling
That smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

You can't shoot me down
Cause you've already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart
With my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby, I'll do, whatever you wanna do, wanna do

You don't have to throw back
Your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer

Every day I clock out
And head straight to her house
We cuddle up on the couch
But it always ends the same ole way
I'm drivin' home and it's incredibly late
Something's got to change, 'cause

I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm takin' him to dinner Sunday night
I've never been so nervous in my life
I want to do this right, 'cause

I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out

And Iâ€™m holding the keys to the brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside? It sure is a nice night
How â€˜bout a little test-drive, down by the lake?
Thereâ€™s a place I know about, where the dirt road runs out
We can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now whataâ€™ ya say? Girl I can hardly wait-
To get a little mud on the tires

Cause itâ€™s a good night, to be out there soakinâ€™ up the moonlight
Steak out a little piece of shoreline, I got the perfect place in mind
Itâ€™s in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
Gotta get a little mud on the tires

Moonlight on a duck vine, catfish on a trout line
Sun sets about nine, this time of year
We can throw a blanket down, crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear
Tell ya what we need to do, grab a sleepinâ€™ bag or two
And build us a little campfire
Then with a little luck, we might just get stuck
Lets get a little mud on the tires

Cause itâ€™s a good night, to be out there soakinâ€™ up the moonlight
Steak out a little piece of shoreline, I got the perfect place in mind

Written by David Kent & Kirsti Manna
Produced by Bobby Braddock


She left without leavin' a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got

If you're callin' 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got somethin' to sell, you're wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone,
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin, I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days, and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say,
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. If this is Austin, I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evenin'
And this is what he heard

If you're callin' 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more

Can't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you

Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doin' what she likes

She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rearview mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doin' what she likes

And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwin' words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doin' what she likes
Doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea

To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words an' read 'em everday
Keep 'em close by don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your 'frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'ma shoot you

[Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town Lax, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1]
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town Lax, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town Lax, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one

Theres freedom in surrender
Lay it down and let it go

You're not alone, stop holding on

It's falling into place
I'm on the throne, stop holding on

You'll know I always have and I always will

You barely have the strength to pray
In the valley low

How hard your fight has been
How deep the pain within
Wounds that no one else has seen
Hurts too much to show

And all the weight that brings you to your knees

He knows, he knows
Every hurt and every sting
He has walked the suffering
He knows, he knows
Let your burdens come undone
Lift your eyes up to the one
Who knows
He knows

We may faint and we may sink
Feel the pain and near the brink
But the dark begins to shrink
When you find the one who knows

The chains of doubt that held you in between
One by one are starting to break free

Every time that you feel alone

The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than

Chorus
But if we are the body
Why aren´t His arms reaching?
Why aren´t His hands healing?
Why aren´t His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren´t His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?
There is a way.

A traveler is far away from home
He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row
The weight of their judgmental glances
Tells him that his chances are better out on the road

Jesus paid much too high a price
For us to pick and choose who should come
And we are the body of Christ

Jesus is the way

Hosanna in the highest

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

BRIDGE:
Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love
Like you have loved me
Break my heart for what breaks yours

Can't be sure when they've hit their mark

I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage

Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

Ten minutes from the beach

Screaming while I pitch

Beating deep on the speakers
Finally riding around the town

One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma
Then my world ends

Before it's too late

And get a little more dirt on my boots

Yeah, a good ol' boy, just like my old man

I know he's looking down
Up there next to Pawpaw
Got the best seats in the house

And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now

Sweep the streets I used to own

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:

Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

When it's my time I probably won't die
I'll just lie down and close my eyes
And think about stuff
These eyes got too wise seen too much of life's goodbyes
Should have spent less time making loot
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you

And everybody upstairs, everybody downstairs
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

'cause I'll be hanging out with you
Not jimmy hendrix, jesus, or the dude
Who played the sheriff in blazing saddles
You, not chris farley, mr. rogers, and oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my mom

Life is good, with love it's better
Even beiber ain't forever
We all got to go you know
So you might as well go in style
Everybody prayin, everybody singing
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

'cause I'll be hanging out with you
Not gilda radner, buddha or the dude
Who had pop rocks and soda at the same time
You, not jessie james, paul newman, and oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my mom

I'm not making light of things
But who's to say who's right with things like this
There's so much that we miss
Tryin so hard to be rich and famous,
Pretty and thin, to win
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young
So forget everything and just be with me here and now
For as long as we can, and whoever goes first save a spot

You, not etta james, bob marley or the girls
Who won my heart along the way
You, not sitting bull, ella or bach and I almost forgot
Oh, and I almost forgot
You can finally meet my mom
You can finally meet my mom
You can finally meet my mom
You can finally meet my mom

No steve jobs or ty cobb, no al capone or any other mob
Whitney Houston, no Chet Baker,

Reminding me of

There is no distraction to mask what is real

One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive a

Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must've forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.

I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,
I forgot about the drought of lightbulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,

But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I'm thinking, ""wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house.""

471,From Eden EP,2014-03-09,hozier,False,Arsonist's Lullabye,"When I was a child, I heard voices
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me

When I was a child I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flames
Something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash

When I was 16 my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me
I knew this sin was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever, tame your demons
Always keep them on a leash

When I was a man I thought it ended
Well I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever, tame your demons

Told me I'd seen a ghost

A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple

How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go?

When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me an everglow

Sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd
Be friends till we die

And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you I know

But when I'm cold, cold

And you're with me wherever I go

Cause our minds change, on what we think is good

But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music
I don't know how I would've fought this

Regardless, all these songs
I'm hearing are so heartless

And don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs
On this record that feel common

I'm in constant confrontation

Or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore
Under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I try to smile
Hoping I just stay the same
And nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you

Next to you in Malibu

for most of the questions in my heart
Why are we here? And where do we go?

Or brings new things for tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too,

But if all of these dreams might find their way
into my day to day scene

Cuts her nails with a razor blade
Says she lives by no one's law
Ran my pride through a big chainsaw
Have you heard of D. B. Cooper?
I got pulled over by an old state trooper
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She cut my face with a razor blade

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I screamed out in fury
Yeah, but my cries were not heard
Yeah, the judge and the jury
Yeah, they could offer no cure

[Verse 2]
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She got a brand new man and they got engaged
The wedding's gon' be on a big green hill
They hope it won't rain but it probably will
The man, he was a football star
He broke his knee, now he sells cars
Only so much that words can do
Love was blind, but they cured that, too
You know, Gandhi has a son our age
He said the freedom thing's just one big cage
I met a girl, her name was Jade
Her husband died, but she kept his name

Yeah, her mom was so worried
Yeah, but she could offer no cure

Boss man calls for a meeting at noon
Big cigar in an oak board room
We got an idea and we think it's great
Said it was too much so we're gonna try eight
Who made love to Scarlet Jo?
And where the hell did Josh Hartnett go?
I met a girl, her name was Jade
Lived her whole damn life in a mascaraed

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I screamed out in fury

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand,
I'll walk with you my dear

Some days I can't even trust myself
It's killing me to see you this way

Our bodies safe to shore

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
There's an old voice in my head
that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss
our little talks
Soon it will be over
and buried with our past
We used to play outside when you were young,
And full of life and full of love

Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear

I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn,
torn apart
There's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon

See a bird soaring high above the flood

I dont hear from them

And here it goes

I'm just a kid I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares
Because I'm alone and the world is having more fun than me
Tonight

And maybe when the night is dead I'll crawl into my bed
Staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.

I felt a little fear upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking.
When the big black horse said ""look this way, hey lady, Will you marry me?""

But I said no, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours,
So it stopped it dead for a beat or two.
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,
and it won't forgive me after all these years

So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

But it said no, no, no,no-no-no

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cuddle woes away
Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart

What's a little bit of hunger? ""

she don't understand she's worth it

Who will be there to take my place

I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm about
Tryin to get so much I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like you're eating Paul Cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't gotta Benz, no just a Honda
But try to get my money like an Anaconda,
Real, real long cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All the pretty girls come flock on me, yeah, I rock the beat

Let em in, let em in, let em in (Hey!)

1, 2, 3, 4 some crazy-ass kids come and knock up on your door so
Let em in, let em in, let em in (Hey!)

And I like my rhymes witty
All my dimes pretty
If you got weed you can come fly with me
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes
Milly vanilly but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shhh!
Shut up bitch and ride this dick
I'm just playin' let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes, and alcohol
Hey, don't forget it when I'm wreckin' it
Etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit
I'm Flyer than a pelican
Young fresh but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm actin' like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in
Fittin' to have a party baby you can tell your friends
We the type lookin' right still settin' trends
Fuck a job I'ma get these dead presidents

Not a day goes by when I ain't gettin' high
They wonder why don't I go get myself a job
So I can make them bucks but I don't give a fuck
No, I feel great, bitch I feel great

and the people that know me
Tryin' to disconnect
thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here
then why am I so lonely?

Find the perfect home

and I ain't tryin' to chase it

Man, we don't waste it

I'm just tryin' to paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn
about, in maybe 40 Years
and I be ready and willing
and able to edit the story
Cause there's so many people here
to be so damn lonely

Right now, right now
I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor
Man searching for the real thing
Meet somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

my mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck, I'm sure as shit
by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul
the soul impossibly
A moment's silence
when my baby puts her mouth on
Me and my babe relaxin' catching manic rhapsody
All reason flown
as God looks on in abject apathy
A swollen Lord that measly a prayer
in perfect parody
A moment's silence
when my baby puts her mouth on me

When the meaning's gone, there is clarity
And the reason comes
in the common tongue of your lovin' me
And it's easy, darling, I need a remedy
And the reason comes
in the common tongue of your lovin' me

What yields the need for those
who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the sin
we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed
is pure authority
This moment's silence
when my baby puts her mouth on me

Since it's all been gone, to its reckoning
Then the reason comes
in the common tongue of your lovin' me
Be thankful, Son, now we lovingly
Let the reason come
to the common tongue of your lovin' me

Like a heathen clung to the harmony
Let the reason come
to the common tongue of your lovin' me

You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fucking tread the ground I'm walking on

That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder
And harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better
You never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow
And writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that have all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards
And stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me
""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces
It's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Fluffed the pillows, made the beds
Stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive
Then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know

King meets queen, then the puppy love thing,
together dream
Bout that crib with the goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until your grown
And notice that the day by day rule can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra off to Sata
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So just know that everything is cool
Yes I will be present on the first day of school, andgraduation

Chorus:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh)
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh)
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Big Boi:
Uh, uh, yeah ""Look at the way he treats me,""

See your lil nose ass homegirls

G, without a pad on, you left the straddlin,
ride this thing on out
And the union girl aint speakin no more
cuz my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about, jealousy,
infedelity, envy
Cheating, beating,

So who you placing the blame on,

Let bygones be bygones,

You and your mama

On Goat, a government-owned alien territory and space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite
It was infinite
As the womb slumbered
And the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life
is not temporal
It is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bares no prejudice
No judgement, but boundless freedom
But on that same day
As the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place
The birth of evil
And as she herself split into two
Rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of joice began its dance
It seems easy to imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered
How can I protect something so perfect without evil? ""

It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up

We are all born superstars

In the glass of her boudoir

'So hold your head up girl and you'll go far

And love your friends

My mama used to pray some day I'd see the light
Never thought it'd be in someone's eyes
In a crowded restaurant on a Friday night
I heard angels sing, my whole life changed
And I realized

My miracle was standing right there
Looking so beautiful with blue jeans and long brown hair
I wasn't always spiritual
Oh but one thing's for sure
How could I not have faith in the God that created her?

To see me now
It's crazy how
My life changed
But here I stand

I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Everyone knows I'm in

I'm becoming the part that don't last

In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down

Of coming back home again

Another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered
Now, for me to light
My dedication
To all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders
With not a regret
My declaration
Embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder
Of how it began

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said

""Play the best song in the world
or I'll eat your soul. "" (soul)

Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other
and we each said... ""Okay. ""

And we played the first thing
that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The Best Song in the World
it was The Best Song in the World

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Needless to say, the beast was stunned
Whip-crack went his Whoopy tail
And the beast was done
He asked us: "" (snort) Be you angels? ""
And we said, ""Nay. We are but men. ""
Rock!
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah-ah
Ohh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!

it didn't actually sound

And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me

And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

675,American Idiot (Deluxe),2004-09-21,green day,True,Homecoming,"[Part I: The Death Of St. Jimmy]

My heart is beating from me
I'm standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no sign of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure what is your pain?
Do you dream to much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
In the crowd of pain.
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says ""we're fucked up""
But we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame

Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
Is my own private suicide

[Part II: East 12th St.]

Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th st.
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world
And he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough
And he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away
I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
Just wanna be free
Is there a possibility
Get me out of here right now, right
This life like dream ain't for me

[Part III: Nobody likes you!]

I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee
And you're still not here
Dreaming of a song
But something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone
'Cause noone's here
Left me here alone
And I should've stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee
I'm thinking (where'd you go?)
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
(Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun

[Part IV Rock And Roll Girlfriend]

Jeez...ha...
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'
In over 22 days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case


[Part V: We're Coming Home Again]
HEY!
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns
are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning
Round and round
Out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We're the ones going

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touched ground
We're back in barrio
And to you and me, that's jingle town

With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And a spoon up your nose
When you wake up in the morning with you head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitching to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you?
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you?
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word last night
You know what everything's about
You had to have the white hot spot light
You had to be a big shot last night

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And with the story of your latest success
You kept them so entertained
But not you just don't remember all the things you
said
And you're not sure that you wanna know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you?
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you?
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone

682,21st Century Breakdown,2009-05-15,green day,False,21 Guns,"Do you know What's worth fighting for,
When It's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weight out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own?
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms

But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beat downs
Cold runna train on punk ho's that
Think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall
And the business that burned us all
See through the news and views that twist reality
Enough
I call the bluff
Manifest destiny

On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

Hardline, hardline after hardline

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

Started as a sketch in my notebook
But now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

Ready for retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box six-under
Impulsive don't ask wild wonder
Orders given to me is
strike and I'm thunder with lightning
fast reflexes on constant alert
from the constant hurt that seems limitless
with no dropping pressure

Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'til they see your brake
They can't conceal the hate
That consumes you
I'm the reason why you flipped your soosa

Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days digit
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
mine's from a canteen

At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life
it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert
with my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker with the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

Your eyes have wondered off
To something
Distant, cold and gray

I guess you didn't see it coming
Someones got use to slumming
Dreamin' of the golden years
I see you had to change careers

Far away
But we both know it's somewhere

I saw you on the back page of
Some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes said
Nothing short of love for pay

I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers

Not today
Send a message to her
A message that I'm coming
I'm coming to persue her

Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I got you ten times over
I'll chase you down till your dead

I saw you on the t.v. station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Now dusted with decay

What happened to the funny papers
Smilling was your money maker
Somone oughta situate her
Find a way to educate her

All the way
It's time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
So never mind what I do

Down home country and
I rest my face on your bed
I'm in my soul bed country
And I left it all for your head

I saw you in the churchyard
There was no time to exchange
You were getting married and
It felt so very strange

I guess I didn't see you coming
Now I guess it's me whos bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears

Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get use to

God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old

Like I told you I'm in for the long, long


Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about in God we trust
Some things slide but this is a must

Like I told you there is a time for finding out


People try to tell me what not to do
They shouldn't make it with a younger girl
And
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well

Like I told you be careful what your asking for


Chours

Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
Hey sister judas
Even you never had my back


She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude but I just didn't care
Had to find out these moments of air
And Stevie said all is fair

Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really really wanted to say
And
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to flee
And

Like I told you there is more than meets the eye


Chorus

Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
I said hey sister judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl you know how to bring the pain

Like I told you I'd do it all again

My head is an animal.
And once there was an animal,
It had a son that mowed the lawn.
The son was an ok guy,
They had a pet dragonfly.
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say.

Her dirty paws and furry coat,
She ran down the forest slope.
The forest of talking trees,
They used to sing about the birds and the bees.

The bees had declared a war,
The sky wasn't big enough for them all.
The birds, they got help from below,
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow.

So for a while things were cold,
They were scared down in their holes.
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines.
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men.
And that's how the story goes,
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws.",en,0.12359550561797752,0.1616574983752987,0.5806451612903226,0.25717703349282295,0.6387812794471783,0.2727272727272727,0.727396859455769,1.0,0.026882914907798275,0.11030937035552252,0.014642082429501083,0.03770919365355358,0.10563082133784929,0.38385834275766545,0.75,0.03513513513513514,0.016296296296296295

735,The Singles Collection,2003-01-01,no doubt,False,Bathwater,"You and your museum of lovers
The precious collection you've housed in your covers
My simpleness threatened by my own admission

And the bags are much too heavy
In my insecure condition
My pregnant mind is fat full with envy again

But I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
I can't help it... you're my kind of man

Wanted and adored by attractive women
Bountiful selection at your discretion
I know I'm diving into my own destruction

So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?
I don't fit in so why do you want me?
And I know I can't tame you... but I just keep trying

'Cause I love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
I'm on you list with all your other women
But I still love to wash in your old bathwater
You make me feel like I couldn't love another
I can't help it... you're my kind of man

Why do the good girls always want the bad boys?

So I pacify problems with kisses and cuddles
Diligently doubtful through all kinds of trouble
Then I find myself choking on all my contradictions

'Cause I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
Share a toothbrush... you're my kind of man
I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Make me feel like I couldn't love another

You had me on my knees

Out of fashion, so I can complain

Thank you, now you're the parasite

And now you're looking like I used to!

With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things

And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be a wife

I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean

I always was the one to fall in love
You came along, I'm hunting you down

Like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life

If we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I always thought I'd be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get
You seem like you'd be a good dad

Taking time

you poor old sod
you see it's only me.

Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze
and the ice that clings on to your beard
was screaming agony.
And you snatch your rattling last breaths
with deep-sea diver sounds,
and the flowers bloom like
madness in the spring.

Pull me towards you

There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide

Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want IT any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'LL think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Attracts filthy flies and pollutes in the skies
Sucks up our lives and proliferates lies

Got a screen for a window about two feet wide
My mind rides and slides as my circuits are fried
No room for thought, use the box as my guide
Trapped in a box

Trapped in a box
Watch the world as it flocks
To life's paradox
We're all trapped in a box

Trapped in a box I'm not alone
I know of others with a box as their home
Light only enters froma crack or a hole
This is not enough for a human to grow
Trapped in a box

Always wanting a different view
Instant gratification for you
Reality gone in a single click
Just hope that that switch won't stick

Controlling my mind, what to eat, what to buy
Subliminal rules: how to live, how to die

Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
the thought is too
Much to concieve

Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness

You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt
I just stuffed it down

Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade

I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

If you could learn to forgive me

In moments of disarray
Succumbing to the games we play
To make sure that it's real

Who knows what we could do
If we can just make it through

Stay here together

815,Dark Horse,2008-10-28,nickelback,False,If Today Was Your Last Day,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned
Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less travelled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
If today was your last day

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause
There's no second try
So live like you're never livin twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make it up by mending a broken heart
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?

Deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk, but

You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here

In the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it`s not a dream

When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak, and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair

When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year

The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone

A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
It is a sprout well budded out
The work of Our Lord's hand""

Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain

You're making me insane

A kiss will only advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water

The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.

Spider murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from illinois went crash, boom, bang,
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang.
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.

Number forty-seven said to number three:
""you're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me.""
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone.
The warden said, ""hey, buddy, don't you be no square.
If you can't find a partner
Use a wooden chair.""
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock.

Shifty henry said to bugs, ""for heaven's sake,
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break.""

Has been and gone

With time to kill
I borrowed Jebbâ€™s rifle
And sat on a hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim

My brotherâ€™s rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brotherâ€™s rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
Thatâ€™s where they found me
My head and my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in the chair
Explain to the court room
What went through you mind
And weâ€™ll ask the jury
What verdict they find

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And heâ€™d come to fetch me
To see what theyâ€™d done
And weâ€™d ride together
To kingdom come
I prayed for godâ€™s mercy
For soon Iâ€™d be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Nevermind, I'll let it happen to you
Out of mind, forget it there's nothing to lose
But my mind and all the things I wanted

Everytime I get it I throw it away

By the time I lose it I'm not afraid
I'm alive but I can Surely fake it

How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see

Forget it

There's a place I see you follow me
Just a taste of all that might come to be
I'm alone but holding breath you can breathe
To question every answer counted

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way

Forget it

It's a crime you let it happen to me
Out of mind, I love it, easy to please
Nevermind, forget it, just memories
On a page inside a spiral notebook

Until I hitched a ride on a river boat queen.

Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time, leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

For ordinary love?

Making up rap beats
Hot cup of tea,
It's four o'clock in the middle of the night,
And I can't sleep

So bad I can taste it
While it eats me

Feels a little bit naked and empty
I'm stuck underneath a few
Dirty old blankets to comfort me

Nosebleeds, palm trees, and tumbleweeds rustling
Outside, they say it's happy here, but it's depressing
Too many pretty faces catching my attention
So I look at them, remind myself in the smudged glass
""That pretty isn't everything, you punk ass""
Always hard to see past the surface, when it looks so perfect
But our eyes will disguise dirt on purpose, you listening?

I grew up here, under the sun
In grade school, I was the odd one, out of the bunch
And I don't mean I was the kid to eat bugs for lunch
I was the one who wasn't coming from where they're coming from
I speak poetically, and never pride my ignorance
But this California shit is rigorous
They say it's happy here, happiness is figurative
I'm happy 'cause of me, doesn't matter where I'm living

If the sun was God, I'd be covered in faith
If the ocean was the devil, I'd be covered in hate
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame

I'm waking up underneath sheets, naked still sweating
Slept in late so everybody else is ready
My friend called up, he said
""Hurry up, buddy, it's almost sundown already. ""
So I hopped up, I went and washed up
I ate some pasta, then I gave my mom hugs
And then I thought, ""Uh, it's gonna be a pretty nice night. ""
But pretty isn't everything, right?

Golden state mind, I'm taking my time
Plain white shirt, and a skinny black tie
My top let down when I get picked up
P. C. H. so California
Maybe they were right; happiness is a warm gun
But before you shoot, please warn us
Life is too fun. California will you marry me?
Let God be the sun and in the ocean they shall bury me

If the sun was God, I'd be covered in faith

Troubled spirits on my chest

Million stars up in the sky
formed a tigers eye
that looked down on my face,
out of time and out of place.

Awaken by the sound
of a screaming owl.
Chasing leafs in the wind,
going where we've never been.

So I'm taking this moment
to live in the future

Release me from the present

Why I'm in denial that they tried

These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only few understand

You don't know my brain
the way you know my name
You don't know my heart
the way you know my face

I hope you're dead
'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People, they rhyme like this
we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it
but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes
three words to a line
it's just poetry divided
I'm the kind of guy who
Takes every moment
he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
You're dead
'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become
common motivation
to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows
to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
but you and I know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
I'm obsessing all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried
The suicidal session

And we're side by side it's always been just you and me

And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones, let's
Take it to the grave
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands

I hope you can make me laugh

Pull our funds and we'll pay the boat together

Living life and treating it as such

You fucked it friend, it's on its head,
it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed, above the highway aisle
(jagged vacancy, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

3rd and lake, it burnt away the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled, far from the highway aisle
(jagged vacancy, thick with ice)

Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean

Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there's no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected

Now I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe if I know all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give.

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

How can I love you?
How can I love you?
How can I love you?
How can I love you?
If you just don't talk to me, babe.

I flow through my act
There's a question: Is she needed?
And decide all the man I can ever be.
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this.

(Do you know?)

Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me.

Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused when I asked you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed

Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested

And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow

There's no ""above"", or ""under"", or ""around"" it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go ""above"", the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going ""under"" starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

I could give up, and boost up my reputation

They would host and post a celebration

My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action

Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion
In spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And, could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that ""it"" does not get glorified

And too much talking with a lazer beam
Gunnin' out of this place

The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car to the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading

Oh the glory that the lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

Oh the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

Oh the glory that the lord has made
And the complications when I see his face
In the morning in the window

Oh the glory when he took our place

The space where you used to be
Your head on my shoulder
All of the plans we made that never happened
Now your scent on my pillow's faded
At least you left me with something

There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me

But the picture's incomplete

There's this empty space you left behind

'Cause I'm missing you
I miss you

Can't make sense of all of the pieces
Of my own delusions
Can't take all these memories
Don't know how to use them

There's a slick washed up onto the beach
I follow the traces
Finding clues in my pockets and opening boxes
And going places we went
Remember to forget
Thinking how it could been
I've turned all my sorrow into glass
It don't leave no shadow

A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born, the first one to run

We're the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

The long lost son
Born on the 4th of july

Raised in an era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive

I am a nation
A worker of pride
My debt to the status quo

The scars on my hands
and the means to an end
is all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride
and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers
and lied through my teeth
the pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge
and I've thrown the bouquet
of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room
Wasting my time
and waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
The ""freedom to obey""
Is the song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line

Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the Tv
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?

Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

Tell of suffering and greed
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

One minute I'm in Central Park.
Then, I'm down on Delancey Street.
Said, from the Bow'ry to St Mark's.
There's a syncopated beat. Right.

~*Pre-Chorus.*~

I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetwise.
I can improvise.
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetsmart.
I've got New York City heart.

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime.
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just be-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire.

~*Verse Two.*~

The rhythm of the city.
But once you get it down.
Said, then you can own this town.
You can wear the crown!

~*Chorus.*~

Why should I worry? Tell me.
Why should I care?
I Said, I may not have a dime. Oh!
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire.

Ev'rything goes.
Ev'rything fits.
They love me at the Chelsea!
They adore me at the Ritz!

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line.
I got street savoir faire.

Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton""
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done
to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' ""Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok? ""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

You can't see where you going
I didn't know who I could trust
So I put all my faith in us
Oh, you tore me to pieces
Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part

But honestly, I do it all again
Putting up with all the bullshit
it made me strong enough to do this

It used to bother me
Thought I could never leave?
After all that I've been through
nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighin' down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through
Nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

I feel freedom where I stand now
And I feel proud from who I am now
Yeah, I learned a lot along the way
I love the woman that I became
I was patient, but not anymore
Respect back in my hands

1117,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967-12-27,leonard cohen,False,Suzanne,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river.
You can hear the boats go by,
You can spend the night beside her.
And you know she's half crazy,
But that's why you want to be there.
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China.
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover.

And you want to travel with her,
And you want to travel blind,
And you know she will trust you,
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.

Now Jesus was a sailor, when he walked opon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower.
And when he knew for certain, only drownding men could see him,
He said: ""All men shall be sailors then, until the sea shall free them.""
But he himself was broken
Long before the skys would open,
Foresaken, almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom, like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river.
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters.
And the sun pours down like honey on our Lady of the Harbor.
And she shows you where to look, among the garbage and the flowers.
There are heros in the seaweed,
There are children in the morning,
They are leaning out for love,
They will lean that way forever,
While Suzanne holds the mirror.

And you want to travel with her,
And you want to travel blind,
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

1119,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967-12-27,leonard cohen,False,Master Song,"I believe that you heard your master sing
when I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
that I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner wine and bread?

You met him at some temple, where
they take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
and he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
of all the kisses we put on some time before.

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
with a collar of leather and nails,
and he never once made you explain or talk
about all of the little details,
such as who had a word and who had a rock,
and who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
and it never stops not even when your master fails.

And he took you up in his aeroplane,
which he flew without any hands,
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
that drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
and, an ape with angel glands,
erased the final wisps of pain
with the music of rubber bands.

And now I hear your master sing,
you kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
that your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
my body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
your shirt is all undone.

And will you kneel beside this bed
that we polished so long ago,
before your master chose instead
to make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
and you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
before he made you go.

Then I think you're playing far too rough
for a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
to get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
who is tapping his foot to a tune,
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
let's say you came back some time too soon.

I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
and I taught him how you would long for me
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do.

I believe that you heard your master sing
while I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,

1120,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967-12-27,leonard cohen,False,The Stranger Song,"(from the album 'SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN')


It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender.

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.

And then leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger.

But now another stranger seems
to want you to ignore his dreams
as though they were the burden of some other
O you've seen that man before
his golden arm dispatching cards
but now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.

Ah you hate to see another tired man
lay down his hand
like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
you notice there's a highway
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder.

You tell him to come in sit down
but something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It's you my love, you who are the stranger.

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
we'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
to get me to the heart of this
or any other matter
When he talks like this
you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this,
you don't know what he's after.

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
upon the shore, beneath the bridge
that they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform
for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind ...

And leaning on your window sill ...

I told you when I came I was a stranger.

I don't even know what love is

Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells

To be brilliant or superior

That you believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But Lord knows that this world is cruel
And ain't the Lord,
know I'm just a fool

don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting
waiting on you?
Must I always be playing
playing your fool?

I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth
never having you
And maybe you been through this before
But it's my first time
So please ignore
The next few lines cause
they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting
waiting on you
I can't always be playing
playing your fool
I keep playing your part
But its not my scene
Won't this plot not twist?
I've had enough mystery.
Keep building me up,
then shooting me down
Well im already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting

Well if I was in your position
Id put down all my ammunition
I'd wondered
why'd it taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And If I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting
waiting on you?
Must I always be playing

No I can't always be waiting

Will this ever end? I'm hoping

Stapled shut, inside and outside world and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home I'm
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
Catastrophic, not again
I'm smearder across the page, and douse in gasoline
I wear you like a stain
yet I'm the one who's obscene
catch me up on all your sorted little insurrections
I've got no time to lose and
I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

Ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt and I
Wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I am a world before I am a man

That you talk in your sleep

Are the secrets that I keep

Hit top speed but I'm still movin
much too slow

There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at

To the shadows of the night

Do your Demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?

We're words without a rhyme

You beware, look out

I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed
mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table
while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long now stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husbands heart problem is complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They've tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on dip, bum on your lips
fuck that,
Cum on your lips & some on your tits
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits,
""Fuck you Debbie!""
Now this looks like a job for me

Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me.

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision of scary, could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
you ask for me?
Well I'm back (da-da-na-na-da-nanana)
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
In up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
(announcer voice)
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
Here's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me.

Now this looks like a job for me

Gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes
And when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat
With your eyes closed
And then moving in silently
Down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder and harder
and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest that you've sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
Dragged down by the stone

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try
And shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable
And no-one had a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart
Everyone's a killer

Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man

1206,Animals,1977-01-23,pink floyd,False,Sheep,"Harmlessly passing your time
In the grassland away;
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air.
You better watch out,
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem.

What do you get for
pretending the danger's not real.
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors
into the valley of steel.
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes.
Now things are really what they seem.
No, this is no bad dream.

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green
He leadeth me the silent waters by.
With bright knives He releaseth my soul.
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places.
He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger.
When cometh the day we lowly ones,
Through quiet reflection
And great dedication,
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.

Bleating and babbling
I fell on his neck with a scream.
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of
Obscurity, into the dream.

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told.

I remember long ago
another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself
and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night
we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were
to fight for freedom in this land

All the nights that never happened
and the days that don't exist

is to breathe or steal a kiss

I can lift you up another semitone

I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She dunt do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes,
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
It's all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
Overt your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
""Sorry love I'll have to turn you down""

He must be up to something
What are the chances sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
it doesn't stop in the winter, no
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town

What a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all",en,0.1348314606741573,0.07608428467685,0.8172043010752689,0.24401913875598086,0.8764527274630929,1.0,0.8396566858480444,0.0,0.39124638969117975,0.03482356377604274,0.0,0.10454249076287765,0.3956392887383573,0.7486689454490004,0.75,0.1472972972972973,0.20148148148148148

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the Usa, the big Cia
The Bloods and The Crips and the Kkk

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate
then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)

Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?

Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin'
as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone

So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in
people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret
it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth
then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds
Faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

Yo', whatever happened
to the values of humanity
Whatever happened
to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding
leading us away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine
You keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow
They kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes you cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over? Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath
I transfer from reality into a living death
I empathize with enemies until the time is right
With God and satan at my side
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don?t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don?t believe that God is dead
God is dead

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the good book said?
Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?

They'll stone you when you're riding in your car.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone you when you walk all alone.
They'll stone you when you are walking home.
They'll stone you and then say you are brave.
They'll stone you when you are set down in your grave.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin',
swingin' madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

1239,Desire,1976-01-16,bob dylan,True,Hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops.""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson that's just the way things go.
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner
and he had a rap for the cops.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out,
they looked likemiddleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in,
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him,
lookin' for somebody to blame.
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter
that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white.""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure.""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail,
be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor.
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail.
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
And though they could not produce the gun,
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
The crime was murder ""one,"" guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell.
That's the story of the Hurricane,
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.",en,0.0898876404494382,0.42470758182714075,0.7634408602150538,0.43660287081339716,0.8261962098209611,0.0,0.6954549887837705,1.0,0.12463896911797377,0.04176948373193533,0.0,0.10780265159747882,0.7512701100762066,0.5355032593364423,0.75,0.7283783783783784,0.05037037037037038
1240,Empire Burlesque,1985-06-08,bob dylan,False,Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside,
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide.
I live in another world where life and death are memorized,
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer,
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere.
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes,
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is.
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized,
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel,
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel.
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies,
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,

I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles
in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby
with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men
with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers
whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords
in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder,
it roared out a warnin',
Heard the roar of a wave
that could drown the whole world,
Heard one hundred drummers
whose hands were a-blazin',
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
Heard one person starve,
I heard many people laughin',
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man
who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
Where the people are many
and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley
meets the damp dirty prison,
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
And reflect it from the mountain
so all souls can see it,
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,

1244,Street-Legal,1978-06-15,bob dylan,False,Changing of the Guards,"Sixteen years,
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves.
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.

Fortune calls.
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.

The cold-blooded moon.
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.

They shaved her head.
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.

I stumbled to my feet.
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.

The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.

Gentlemen, he said,
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

Peace will come
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

I heard your suitcase say goodbye
And as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love is suicide

You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'll pray to God to give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'll steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your valentine

When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

1261,The Pains Of Growing,2018-11-30,alessia cara,False,7 Days,"If there's a God
Do you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?
As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?
Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter
Making boring people famous
Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters

We're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good Tv

Oh Mr. Man upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste
That we've made
Would you say? Please say
It was worth the seven days

Does he hang his head in all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the [?] stress
Like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static you show what's the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?

'Cause we're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, but don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created has made for damn good Tv

Oh, Mr. Man upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste
That we've made
Would you say? Please say
It was worth the seven days

Don't touch the remote
We'll be back in a moment
We are not hopeless
We are just coping
The mayhem is rolling
But it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent
Chaotic, I know it
But we're growing
Have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave us?

Oh, Mr. Man upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless

(verse 1)
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind
when it Breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo. I
Mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we've got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could you be so dr. Evil
you bringin' out the side of Me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up 3 a. M. On the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I wont stop, I wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

(chorus)
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless

(verse 3)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you cant believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you cant make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night
